# Pediatric-Appendicitis-Prediction-using-Random-Forest
R-based data science project to build a predictive model for diagnosing pediatric appendicitis. Using clinical and lab data, I developed a Random Forest classifier to distinguish between appendicitis and no appendicitis cases. The project includes data cleaning, preprocessing, model tuning with cross-validation, and performance evaluation.
